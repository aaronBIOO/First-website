# My first Website 
I'm creating a basic website.
It's a website for discovering experiences in the real world.
It will allow people to explore different experiences. Tickets will be used to book an event on the platform.
It also has calender for managing dates and time of booked events. 
The ticket section is used to manage ticket purchased.
